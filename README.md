# LendingClub-Investment-Strategy
The data is from LendingClub website and this project is to evaluate three different strategies. Return-based Strategy is to select stocks with the highest predicted return. Default based strategy is to select the stocks with the lowest default probability. Return-default based
strategy is to select the best stocks with high return and low default probability. We use a classifier to predict default probability, and use
a regressor to predict return. The classifier is chosen from Logistic regression, random forest, and perceptron. The regressor is chosen from linear regression and deep learning model. The result shows default based strategy has the best performance.
